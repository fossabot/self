# Mobile app docstring style guide

Docstrings for the React Native app live alongside the source in `app/src`. We follow [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org) conventions so that typed tooling can generate consistent API documentation.

## Authoring guidelines

- Document every exported component, hook, utility, or type alias with a leading `/** ... */` block written in the imperative mood.
- Include `@param`, `@returns`, and `@remarks` tags when they improve clarity, especially for side-effects or platform-specific behaviour.
- Keep examples concise. Prefer inline code blocks for short snippets and use fenced blocks only when you need multiple lines.
- Mention platform differences explicitly (for example, “iOS only”) so consumers understand the scope of the implementation.

## Coverage expectations

Docstring coverage is now monitored through `yarn docstrings:app` and the aggregate `yarn docstrings:report`. The GitHub Actions workflow uploads JSON snapshots from `docs/coverage/*.json`, but coverage targets are not enforced yet—missing docstrings will not block builds. Treat the reports as guardrails and follow up in subsequent PRs if you need to land behaviour quickly.
